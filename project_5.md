## Blockchain

Following the instructions from the project, I used a linked list to form a block chain. What is slighltly different from a normal linked list is that the current node requires a previous_hash from the previous node.

Time complexity O(N), where N is number of node in linked list
Space complexity O(N), where N is number of node in linked list
