## LRU Cache

For the LRU Cache problem, I used the doubly linked list (DLL) structure to implement, following the existing online resources: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/. The DLL allows removing nodes from either side of the DLL without traversing the linked list. 

Time Complexity: O(1)

Space complexity: O(N), where N is the size of the cache
